# Glas-E-Go

E-Vehicle Sharing Platform, GLAS'E-GO developed collaboratively using the Tkinter platform and integrated with SQLite3 database, is a testament to our dedication to sustainability, efficiency, and technological innovation.

Through an intuitive user interface and streamlined database management, we prioritise user convenience and efficient vehicle utilization, saving time and enhancing the overall experience.

Application functions such as operator job management, manager monitoring, and client registration have all undergone extensive testing and rigorous design. The application's stability and capacity to meet the requirements and expectations stated at the project's beginning have been confirmed by the positive outcomes of all test cases.
